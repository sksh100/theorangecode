# 🎯 FOUND THE DEPLOY BUTTON!

## The Deploy Button is Hidden! Here's Where to Find It:

### 📍 Location:
**In the Vercel dashboard:**
1. **Look at the top-right corner** of your screen
2. **Find "Share" button**
3. **Click "Share"**
4. **Click "Publish" tab**
5. **Click "Deploy" button** 🎉

That's it! The deploy button is now in the Share menu!

## Alternative: Just Wait
Since we pushed to GitHub, Vercel might auto-deploy in 1-2 minutes. Check the "Deployments" tab to see if it's deploying!

## After You Click Deploy:
- Wait 1-5 minutes
- Your site will be live at https://theorangecode.com! 🚀

**Try the Share → Publish → Deploy path now!**
