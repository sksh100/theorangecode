## Testing

You can test the coming soon page locally:

```
Then visit `http://localhost:3000/coming-soon`

## Design Philosophy

The page follows your brand guidelines:
- âœ… Uses azure and darkAzure branding colors exclusively
- âœ… No purple or basic styling
- âœ… Luxurious, professional appearance
- âœ… Premium feel worthy of your brand
- âœ… No grid lines
- âœ… Smooth animations and transitions
- âœ… Glass-morphism effects for modern look

## Technical Notes

- Built with Next.js 14 App Router
- Uses Framer Motion for animations
- Fully responsive with Tailwind CSS
- Follows your existing component structure
- No breaking changes to your current site
- Client-side rendered for performance
- Matches your site's existing styling exactly

Your coming soon page is now ready to go live! ðŸš€
