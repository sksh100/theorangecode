# Final Step: Deploy Your Project!

Your domain is added but needs a deployment. Here's how to deploy:

## Quick Deployment Steps:

### Option 1: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to GitHub** (if not already there):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add coming soon page for The Orange Code"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **In Vercel dashboard:**
   - Go to your project "theorangecode"
   - Click "Deployments" tab
   - If GitHub is connected, it will auto-deploy
   - OR click "Deploy" button

### Option 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI

1. **Install Vercel CLI** (if not installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login and deploy:**
   ```bash
   vercel login
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Option 3: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard

1. In Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Deployments"
3. Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy" button
4. Select your latest commit

## After Deployment:

âœ… Your site will automatically link to `theorangecode.com`
âœ… The "No Deployment" warning will disappear
âœ… Your coming soon page will be live!
âœ… HTTPS/SSL will be active automatically

## Your Live URLs Will Be:

- https://theorangecode.com (main page)
- https://theorangecode.com/coming-soon (coming soon page)
- https://theorangecode.vercel.app (Vercel preview domain)

## That's It!

Once deployed, your beautiful coming soon page will be live on the internet! ðŸš€
