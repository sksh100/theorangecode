# Link Your Domain to Your Project

You already have the domain `theorangecode.com` set up in Vercel! Now you just need to link it to your project.

## Quick Steps:

1. **Go to your project** in Vercel dashboard
2. Click **"Settings"** (in the left sidebar)
3. Click **"Domains"** 
4. Click **"Add Domain"** button
5. Type: `theorangecode.com`
6. Click **"Add"**

That's it! Vercel will:
- ✅ Automatically configure everything
- ✅ Set up HTTPS/SSL certificate
- ✅ Make your site live

## What You'll See:

After adding the domain, you should see:
- ✅ Verified status
- ✅ SSL certificate (HTTPS)
- ✅ Your site will be live at:
  - https://theorangecode.com (main page)
  - https://theorangecode.com/coming-soon (coming soon page)

## Timeline:

- Usually takes 1-5 minutes for Vercel to set everything up
- Your domain is already configured, so there's no DNS wait time needed!

## That's All!

Your coming soon page and main site will be live immediately after adding the domain to your project.
